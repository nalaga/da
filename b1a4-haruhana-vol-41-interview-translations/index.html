<p><b>B1A4 who returned to Japan with a cheerful and refresh song after a long while!</b></p>
<p><b>What kind of songs will they bring us, we are looking forward to it!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: B1A4 members reconfirmed their fate through a 2 days 1 night filming! The group stepped forward as they changed their Japan label this year. The first single which they released &#8220;You and I&#8221; by Jinyoung, and the coupling song &#8220;Blue Moon&#8221; by CNU, both in charged of writing and composing the song themselves.</b></p>
<p><b>JY: </b>You and I is a song that is filled with the meaning of wanting to launch forward hand in hand with our fans.<br /><b>BR:</b> When I first listened to things song, I want to have fun with the fans.<br /><b>SD:</b> It is a refreshing feel and fits B1A4 perfectly.<br /><b>CNU: </b>Blue Moon is a song about the longing for the girl who have left. I thought it would be a song where people can see a different side of us.</p>
<p><b><br /></b></p>
<p><b>Q: If there is a change after you changed label?<br />BR: </b>I am feeling new about it. We also want to work harder to meet those fans we are staying in far away places and have not met before.<br /><b>JY: </b>The people working in the label has vast knowledge about music, so when we talk, I get inspirations. I am looking forward to what kind of music will we make in the future.<br /><b>GC:</b> We tried something new and covered other artist&#8217;s song. I feel that I might be a good chance for those who do not know us up till now.<br /><b>SD:</b> The song we covered, Choo Choo train, is a very popular song and I hope that people feel closer to us through this.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: You guys filmed your MV for Choo Choo train in a Japan ski resort, how was it?<br />GC:</b> Right now, the members are staying separately, because we had to the film the MV, we stayed in the same building. It has been a long time since we slept together, and it felt good as expected. Things of the past came to our mind, and felt that we need to stay together.<br /><b>JY:</b> We went back to being young and had snow fights together.<br /><b>BR:</b> Also, there was an episode, while filming, a spark from the campfire flew to my head. (laughs) It was very hot so I flew into the snow.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: In You and I, the word future came up. What if you guys could go into the future?<br />JY: </b>I want to see my child. How much do we look alike, what kind of kid, a male or a female, and hopefully there will be about 2-3 of them.<br /><b>GC: </b>I want to see my wedding ceremony. I am curious about who the opposite party is and also curious about who came.<br /><b>CNU: </b>We have a song called !0 years later, I want to see myself in 10 years later. I feel that the fans will be there even then and I want to thank them.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: The things you want to do with Japanese fans in the future?<br />SD: </b>We did it once in Korea, having a picnic with fans.<br /><b>All: </b>Me too!<br /><b>CNU:</b> Go on a picnic, play games, and have lots of fun with them.<br /><b>GC:</b> It would be good to go flower viewing too. Or rent a cruise?</p>
<p><b>BR:</b> Sounds good~~<br /><b>SD:</b> CNU hyung will buy the cruise! We will board that and have fun together~ (laughs)</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>B1A4&#8217;s results!<br />A research of B1A4&#8217;s interest as we give them two choices! Ignoring the group name and questions that make them choose! Which side would they be on and what answer is closest to their interest? Members who don&#8217;t hesitate to say &#8220;I am on this side!&#8221;, what would the questions that divide B1A4 be?</b></p>
<p><u><br /></u></p>
<p><b><u>Q1: If you were to date in spring?</u><br /><span style="color: rgb(70, 65, 217);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 221);">B: Do sports togeth</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 221);">er</span></span></b> &#8211; Sandeul: I fun sports fun~<br /><b><span style="color: rgb(255, 187, 0);">A: Do picnic together</span><span style="color: rgb(31, 218, 17);"> </span></b>&#8211; Gongchan, CNU, Jinyoung, Baro: A warm spring calls for a picnic.<br />Right on the first question, the boys created a B1-A4, surprising them!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Picnic in the day, sports at night, both sides are satisfied?!</b></p>
<p><b>SD: </b>Since I like sports, I want to have fun together! Golf, bowling, table tennis&#8230; I also like cycling~<br /><b>BR:</b> Other than Sandeul, the four of us chose picnic. The weather in spring is nice, the warm sun rays, I want to spread out the mat and eat delicious food leisurely~<br /><b>CNU:</b> It is about the delicious food when it comes to picnic. For my girlfriend, I would make the food myself and bring lunch boxes there. Kimbab, sandwich, salad, whatever food there it.<br /><b>GC:</b> I have the same reasons as the hyungs. The weather is spring is nice, I want to have fun outside.<br /><b>JY:</b> I would want to picnic in the day and exercise at night&#8230; (laughs) I want to do jogging too!</p>
<p><b><u>Q2: If I were to travel with the members?</u></b><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 221);"><b>B: Entrust it to the rest</b></span> &#8211; Sandeul, Gongchan: Bring me to the good places~<br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 187, 0);"><b>A: I will lead the way and set up plans</b></span> &#8211; Shinwoo, Jinyoung, Baro: I find it more fun to lead and set plans rather then follow around.<br />The result is B2A3!</p>
<p><b><br /></b></p>
<p><b>When we went to Bali, Baro was the one who planned everything! The gang who follows everything~ Sandeul &amp; Gongchan</b><br />GC: Last year, Baro, Sandeul and I went to Bali for a trip together. That time, Baro was the one who planned everything. Where to go, what to eat and spoke good English, he was in charged of everything (laughs)<br />BR: The make me want to bring them to a good place. I am usually the kind who likes setting plans for myself.<br />JY: I also feel happy when I bring the members somewhere.<br />BR: If all five of us were to go on a holiday together, where will we go?<br />JY: Jeju Island is good, Japan is good too.<br />SD: Okinawa!<br />GC: Hokkaido! Oeta, Beppu hot springs!<br />JY: We will obviously have fun no matter where the five of us go.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><u>Q3: I eat my favourite food&#8230;</u></b><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 221);"><b>B: Last</b></span> &#8211; Sandeul, Gongchan, Shinwoo: A gourmet will eat the nice food last!<br /><b><span style="color: rgb(255, 187, 0);">A: First </span></b>&#8211; Jinyoung, Baro: We wouldn&#8217;t be able to eat if our tummies are full~<br />Results is B3A2!</p>
<p><b><br /></b></p>
<p><b>The reason why we eat the food last is because of a gourmet? Sandeul is a paradox!</b><br /><b>JY:</b> There are a lot of things to eat towards to end. If I were to leave the food to the last, if I am full, then wouldn&#8217;t I not be able to eat it anymore?<br /><b>BR:</b> Something for the change, I wish to fill my tummy with the things I like to eat.<br /><b>SD:</b> Nono. If you were to eat the thing you like first, the subsequent food will have no taste!<br /><b>CNU &amp; GC: </b>Oh~~~<br /><b>SD:</b> So eat the food that you don&#8217;t like first, and the food that you like would be like a finale.<br /><b>CNU: </b>Even with meat, you eat the part where you need to chew first, and then you slowly move on to the marbling where the soft meat is.<br /><b>GC: </b>Yes yes, a gourmet eats like that. I agree~!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><u>Q4: If you were to confess to the person you like?</u></b><br /><b><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 221);">B: Beat around the bush to appeal and wait for the opposite party to confess</span><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 187, 0);">A: Confess personally</span></b><br />Results A5! The members all have the same opinion!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Your secret line for confessing?</b><br /><b>All:</b> Definitely saying it personally~!<br /><b>JY:</b> Isn&#8217;t Sandeul is a little different? (laughs)<br /><b>SD:</b> Nono, I said I would say it personally!<br /><b>BR:</b> I guess the reason is all the same. Because we are guys!<br /><b>GC:</b> Yes!<br /><b>CNU:</b> Just like what he said.<br /><b>BR:</b> It is a guy&#8217;s job to confess.<br /><b>CNU: </b>If you were to confess, what kind of words would you use to confess?<br /><b>GC:</b> Ka-be-dong! (Corner her against the wall) <br /><b>SD:</b> (Imitates Gongchan and pretend to corner him to the wall)<br /><b>All:</b> (laughs)<br /><b>BR: </b>I like you, what about you?<br /><b>CNU:</b> Because I like you, please be mine.<br /><b>JY:</b> I have been liking you. Would you like to go out with me?<br /><b>GC:</b> Oh~~~ Everyone is cool!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q5: Just like your blood type with 1 B and 4 A, make a question! And the question that the members made is &#8220;I bother about my fashion no matter how tired I am&#8221;</b></p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 221);">B: I care</span> </b>&#8211; Baro<br /><b><span style="color: rgb(255, 187, 0);">A: I don&#8217;t care</span> </b>&#8211; Gongchan, Shinwoo, Jinyoung, Sandeul.</p>
<p>Just like what we said, B1A4 question is finished!! They hesitate and wondered what would there be and in the end decided on this!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>BR:</b> No matter what kind of situation it is, I want to be fashionable.<br /><b>Others:</b> Comfortable clothes are the best! (laughs)</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Cool guy Baro&#8217;s is the only one who chose B! B1A4!</b><br /><b>SD: </b>Since its taking a long time, let&#8217;s make a question that makes Baro the B.<br /><b>JY: </b>B for the one who have nothing on his mind while eating (laughs)<br /><b>GC: </b>B for the person who raps the best<br /><b>BR: </b>The person who likes jajangmyeon? The other option would be jjambbong</p>
<p><b>GC: </b>I am jjambbong</p>
<p><b>SD:</b> Me too.<br /><b>CNU: </b>It&#8217;s sweet and sour pork for me.<br /><b>GC: </b>Then this won&#8217;t do (laughs)<br /><b>BR:</b> Ah, B for the person who will takes care of fashion no matter how tired he is. Since I will make sure to coordinate my clothes no matter how tired.<br /><b>CNU:</b> Other than Baro, everyone likes comfortable clothes.<br /><b>JY: </b>Only when it comes to airport fashion<br /><b>CNU:</b> Sandeul don&#8217;t really care about fashion isn&#8217;t it?<br /><b>SD: </b>I do! (laughs)<br /><b>BR:</b> I said care all the time!<br /><b>Others:</b> Only when it comes to airport fashion.</p>

<p><i>About their new song You &amp; I</i></p>
<p><i>Get to know about this and that!</i></p>
<p><i>XX &amp; I talk</i></p>
<p><i>Since it is related to the new song, we divided the talks into these different categories &#8220;B1A4&#8221;, &#8220;FASHION&#8221;, &#8220;LOVE&#8221;, &#8220;MUSIC&#8221;, &#8220;BANA&#8221;.</i></p>
<p><i>Things about the members, the fashion they like, episodes when they feel their family&#8217;s love, the things they want to challenge in terms of music, their thoughts about fans. Let&#8217;s know it all now!</i></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">B1A4 &amp; I</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><br /></span></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10pt;"><b>JY:</b> If I were to describe B1A4 in one word, it would be family. In real life, I meet the members more than I meet my family, and I spent most of my life with them, even though we are not blood related, I feel that we are like a family. I am always thankful for the members. Even though I am a leader, all of them are doing very well so I don&#8217;t really need much support. As much as I am thankful, I am sorry that as a leader, there are times that I am unable to do more for them. I want to continue promoting as B1A4 and create more awareness and become a nation&#8217;s group 10 years down the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10pt;"><b><br /></b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10pt;"><b>CNU: </b>B1A4 is like a family to me too. Precious like a family and giving strength to one another. Even though we are as close as family, there isn&#8217;t once when we fought. There are of course times when we don&#8217;t see eye to eye, but during then, we don&#8217;t deny it because it is different, instead, we talk about it and try to understand each other. We also check on the broadcasts that other members go on. When I see them being active and working hard, I get motivated and tell myself that I have to work harder too. I feel that music is something that makes the world unite, so I want to be a group who can spread music to the entire world and receive love from the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10pt;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10pt;"><b>SD: </b>B1A4 is like a very important treasure to me. As to why I say so, the career as a singer to me is very precious, it is a dream that is like a treasure. Because B1A4 is the one who fulfilled this dream, so I want to stay together like this forever. Like a flower that doesn&#8217;t fade away, I hope that within my heart, B1A4 will always be blooming. We have a song called 10 years later. The contents goes something like what we are doing right now, 10 years later, who will be there for us, and we don&#8217;t know if there will be anything left. I let that song be a warning to me, to work hard to the best that I can so that 10 years later, all 5 of us can still be together.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>BR: </b>B1A4 are friends forever. The members have been together from the past till now. We are always working together, sleeping together, eating together, and because we spend more time with each other than with our family, there are no other words that I can think of to describe this other than friends. Family-like friends whom I want to spend time with even when we grow old. I want to work hard as a member of B1A4 10 years ago, and I want to make fans feel like we didn&#8217;t grow old at all. Not losing to young idols, I want to be a cool senior who is always full of energy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>GC: </b>If I were to put B1A4 in one word, it would be water. To be, B1A4 is something that I cannot live without. I can feel that we are always thinking for each other. I am really thankful that the members are always looking out for the rest before themselves. I want to be a better group as B1A4 10 years later and I hope that the members can become closer to the image they want to be. Personally, I want to be able to give strength to the people whom I like.</p>

<p><b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">FASHION &amp; I</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>JY:</b> The fashion items I like are watches, I bought it recently too, but after I bought it, I have no idea why but I don&#8217;t like it&#8230; (laughs). Right now I am just keeping it at home. My favourite choice of clothes are black colour. The clothes I have are mostly balck. When I sleep, I like to wear soft and fluffy grey pyjamas. I like it because I like the texture.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>CNU:</b> I did shopping today! Since there was some time, I went to Harajuku and bought a family jacket which I really wanted. The clothes that matches me the most, and the clothes I have the most are dark coloured clothes. I also like colours that are eye catching. I also wear red and blue clothes. When I sleep, I don&#8217;t wear anything, even the underwear. When I was in my 10s, I did this and came to know that it is comfortable. I like the feeling of the blanket touching my skin.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>SD: </b>Since I started attending sports class since I was 5 years old, from then onwards, I thought training outfits are the most comfortable, and when we wear something, we have to wear comfortable stuffs! (laughs). When I grow up, even though it is a little embarrassing&#8230; When I hear Baro telling me &#8220;You clothes are weird&#8221; I get embarrassed. However, until I really get it from someone directly, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell that my clothes are weird. Recently I bought vans sneakers and jerseys, cos they are comfortable. (laughs)</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>BR:</b> I like that I am able to challenge fashion. It is not that I have sense, but I try to wear things that are attractive, I learn what is cool and what is strange when I ask &#8220;How are my clothes today?&#8221;. Recently I bought vans sneakers and sun hats, and is enjoying the street hip hop style.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>GC: </b>I like black turtle necks. If I open my drawer, other than the clothes that I&#8217;ve received, all of them are black. The hyungs have their own style. Baro&#8217;s is street, Jinyoung&#8217;s dandy, Shinwoo&#8217;s in the middle of those two, Sandeul&#8217;s training outfit (laughs). I am taking reference and good points from them.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">LOVE &amp; I</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>JY:</b> When I chat with my family on the phone, I feel that it is really a great support for my work. They will praise me for the broadcasts that I go on, just that one word can give me strength. My ideal type is someone warm hearted. I find someone with good manners attractive. Depending on the person&#8217;s actions, I get jealous. For example when she says this like &#8220;That person is cool..&#8221;, I will feel jealous. Even though I know it is not on purpose, at the starting I will feel jealous, I find it cute~</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>CNU: </b>I feel my family&#8217;s love when they call and we ask each other &#8220;Have you eaten?&#8221;, &#8220;Are you healthy?&#8221;, though my character is one who doesn&#8217;t contact much. My ideal type is someone who understands me, a girl who embraces me warmly like how a mother would. However, I hope that she will sometimes wants to lean on me. I am someone who gets jealous very easily. I hope that the person I like can look at me only. Frequently when fans tell me that they are getting married, I will reply &#8220;I object this marriage!&#8221; (laughs)</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>SD: </b>Not long ago, my grandma passed away. She waited for me till the last moments, when she heard me say &#8220;Granny, I&#8217;m here&#8221; her pulse went up slightly, its feels as if she knows that I am there. She passed away after getting to hear my voice. I felt like she must&#8217;ve wanted to see me. After that incident, I feel that I cannot not treasure my family more. Even though it is hard to express our affections for the family, but we cannot not be honest about it. I am originally someone who finds it hard to do it but I am trying my best.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>BR:</b> Yesterday my little sister debuted. My father is staying in my hometown whereas my mother is here in Seoul, the three of us stays together. When my sister was a trainee, I wasn&#8217;t about to chat well with her because I was busy, but now she debuted and I managed to chat with her after a long while. I watched all the music broadcasts she went on, rather than giving her advice, I am cheering for her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t feel down even if you hear bad stuffs, there will be people supporting you if you work hard. Let&#8217;s gain strength to gather.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>GC:</b> There was once my mother knew that I was overseas and she made a point to match the timing and contacted me. &#8220;I feel that she still watch over me even when I am far away, and I feel her love&#8221;. My ideal type is someone who really likes me and makes it very obvious. If my girlfriend goes out and play with her friends, I will tell her to &#8220;come back safely&#8221; and be slightly worried about her. As a guy (human), I think we will all be worried.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">MUSIC &amp; I</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>JY:</b> The song that I listen to a lot recently is a song called Woman by Honne. The voice is really good, when I listen to it, my heart feels at peace. There are a lot of times when I shower and listen to songs. When I listen to songs while getting water splashed on my body, it gives a different feeling too. Musically, the things I want to challenge is making a new genre. Even though there might have been everything but I feel like that is more. I want to keep challenging.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>CNU: </b>I must listen to music when I shower. If I don&#8217;t listen to music, it feels like as if I am not showering. I will listen to various songs on random. Musically, my goals is to give a song to Gongchan within this year. His voice is soft and beautiful, and everything thinks that he suits singing ballad songs, but I want to challenge on something else. (GC: It doesn&#8217;t matter what kind of genre. Just give me a song that will hit #1 on Oricon chart. (laughs)).</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>SD: </b>When it comes to music, honestly, it feels a little scary. Even though I have been nothing but &#8220;someone who sings&#8221; since I was young, I am worried if I will be able to sing for the rest of my life, if things don&#8217;t go well, how can I overcome it, there are such worries. Even though it is not possible to not get stressed and sing, but on the other hand, if I don&#8217;t work hard, it is not possible too! There are a lot of things I want to challenge in the future. Even though my voice suits rock and ballad, I will research on funk or R&amp;B and want to sing romantic songs with a gentle voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>BR:</b> Music is like my right hand. I have not thought of the day where I can&#8217;t do music, I want to keep doing it. If I still do rap when I turn into a grandfather, isn&#8217;t that very cool? (laughs). Because I really love rap, and I really love hip hop, there are still a lot of things that I cannot not do. If it is possible, I want to release a hip hop album. I haven&#8217;t got much chance to show it other than in concerts, the fans are also waiting for it. However, I feel that it is not the time to do that yet, but I hope it can be fulfilled one day.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>GC:</b> Recently, I have been listening to the song called &#8220;Just 10 more mins&#8221; but a 2 man group named Ants. The song is about fetching a girlfriend home and not wanting to part, asking to give 5 mins more, 10 mins more. I feel that such feelings are the same when we are together with BANAs. Whenever a concert, or a fanmeeting, we always hope that we have 10 mins more, especially since even if we don&#8217;t talk, we still feel good, it is great if we can meet banas for even just 10mins. That way, when each of us is going through a difficult time, we have something memorable to think about.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">BANA &amp; I</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>JY:</b> I feel that I always want to meet banas. So whenever we meet, be it concert or what, it is always fun. I want to be together for a long time, I feel like this feeling gives each other strength. Whenever I want to see them I update my SNS and check the comments of banas. A memorable thing that we did together was going on a picnic. It was the first time we got so closed together and because of that it was memorable. It would be great if we could do that with the Japanese banas one day. The things I want to ask banas would be what is the part that you like about us. I want to know it specifically.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>CNU:</b> Right now at this moment I want to meet banas. I want to meet them everyday. There are days when we get stressed out, days when we feel difficult, whenever that happens, I think of banas and gained strength. When I want to mee them, I got on the SNS to read their comments. There are a lot of impressive moments with banas so it is hard to just quote one, but if I were to say one, it would be during last year&#8217;s comeback. It was the first time showing them a performance through a showcase and their screams were all happy, and it was memorable. The things that I want to ask them everyday would be &#8220;Have you eaten today?&#8221;, &#8220;Are you sick today?&#8221;. I hope they eat well and stay healthy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>SD:</b> Banas are treasures to me like how B1A4 is. It is very precious to me and I hate it if people takes it away from me, so I keep it in a vault. I want to use our singing to capture the hearts of banas so that no one can take them away from us. When we stand on the stage and meet banas, i feel the happiest. Recently, I felt that the time passed really fast. Kids who once wore uniform now are wearing suits when they come to see us, elementary school kids are now wearing school uniforms. They say &#8220;Oppa, I am now 20 years old&#8221;, and I will reply &#8220;Wow, already 20 years old?!&#8221;. It has been 7 years since we debuted isn&#8217;t it. I don&#8217;t feel it when I do other things, but when we meet banas, I feel that be it banas or us, we have grown.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>BR: </b>Banas are people with presence that are hard to express using words. We debuted for 7 years, and because banas has been walking this path with us till now, I feel that the distance between banas and us are closer now. For example, kids in high school are becoming university students and becoming an adult. It feels like seeing a long time friend growing up and feeling proud. When we stand on the stage and up till the moment we disappear backstage, I want to keep singing and till then, there is no happiness that tops the fact that we can be together. 30-40 years down the road when we have white hair and our wrinkles increase&#8230; even then I want to ask if banas will still be there cheering for us.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>GC: </b>Before I sleep, I will always recall on the things that happened on that day, what are banas doing, are they eating well, are they sleeping well, they are the top when I think about such stuffs. When its days we don&#8217;t have anything, I will feel very lonely. So I will think about whether the banas will still maintain such unforgettable relationship with us, that is why i started replying banas on twitter. When I search and play on the internet with them, i feel like our distance between us would be closer. Banas has their work and school work so there are also times when they want to meet us but can&#8217;t. I want to ask them &#8220;During such times, what do you do?&#8221;.</p>

I think it will be an interesting production so please look forward to it!</p>
